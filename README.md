E-commerce App. There is no RWD styling!

I think this is the most important project in my repository. Here I was able to use local API and test fetching/deleting data using react-router. Here I practiced usage of: 
- How to create and use loaders
- useLoaderData
- useParams
- Local Storage
- How to load min/page of products from API
- How to gather information on how many products I will receive from the response (for pagination)
- useContext with Outlet component
- How to create paths, nested paths,  redirect
- Form , Link and NavLink components
- Views
- Layout

For styling I used module.css

I constructed the entire styling from scratch using the Figma project. https://www.figma.com/file/72Lr3t2FqKeDUA8iWOkDcm/Zrozumie%C4%87-React---Projekt-Praktyczny?node-id=0%3A1&mode=dev

Project created durign "Zrozumiec React" course where I learned how to fetch data with React, ReactRouter, basics of Next.js various types of react hooks such as: useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer, useMemo, useCallback, useRef. - https://zrozumiecreact.pl/
